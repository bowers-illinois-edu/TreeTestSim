Description: This package helps researchers study hypothesis testing procedures when those hypotheses are organized in a tree-like structure. It has functions to generate k-ary trees with known proportions of leaves and nodes have non-zero or zero effects, enables the creation of simulated block or strata randomized experimental designs that can be organized in a nested tree-like format, and has helper functions which can be run to explore the impact of different analytic decisions on the outcomes of the testing.
