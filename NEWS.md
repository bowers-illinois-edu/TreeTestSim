# TreeTestSim 0.0.0.9300

## Breaking changes

* `simulate_test_DT()` and `simulate_many_runs_DT()` now parameterize
  non-null p-value generation via `effect_size` (Cohen's d) instead of
  `beta_base`. The new parameter has a direct scientific interpretation: it
  is the standardized mean difference at each non-null leaf. Together with
  `N_total` and the tree structure, power at every level is derived
  automatically.

* Removed `beta_base`, `effN`, `adj_effN`, and `delta_hat` parameters from
  `simulate_test_DT()`. Removed `beta_base` and `adj_effN` from
  `simulate_many_runs_DT()`. The old `adj_effN` logical is replaced by
  `power_decay` (same default behavior: `TRUE`).

* Removed internal helper `derive_delta_hat()`. Its role is replaced by
  `effect_size_to_beta()`, which converts Cohen's d directly to a Beta shape
  parameter without the intermediate round-trip.

## New features

* `simulate_test_DT()` now returns `root_power` in `sim_res` — the
  theoretical power at the root level computed from `effect_size` and
  `N_total`.

* New internal helper `effect_size_to_beta(effect_size, N_level, alpha)`
  converts Cohen's d at a given sample size to the Beta(a, 1) shape
  parameter used for p-value generation.

# TreeTestSim 0.0.0.9201

## Bug fixes

* Fixed test helper `err_testing_fn()` using bare `filter()` which resolved to
  `stats::filter` instead of `dplyr::filter` during non-interactive test runs.
  Replaced with data.table subsetting to remove the implicit dplyr dependency.

## New features

* `simulate_test_DT()` gains `alpha_method = "adaptive_power"`, which uses
  `manytestsr::compute_adaptive_alphas()` to precompute a depth-indexed alpha
  schedule based on estimated power decay through the tree. New parameters
  `delta_hat` and `tau` control the schedule; when `delta_hat = NULL` it is
  derived automatically from `beta_base` and `N_total`.

* `simulate_test_DT()` now always computes **both** bottom-up hommel and
  bottom-up BH adjustments on leaf p-values, returning six new columns:
  `bu_hommel_false_error`, `bu_hommel_true_disc`, `bu_hommel_power`,
  `bu_bh_false_error`, `bu_bh_true_disc`, `bu_bh_power`. The existing
  `bottom_up_*` columns are preserved for backward compatibility.

* New function `generate_synthetic_experiment()` creates a synthetic
  block-randomized experiment organized as a complete k-ary tree. Returns
  individual-level and block-level data.tables with a `lvls_fac` factor
  suitable for `manytestsr::splitSpecifiedFactorMulti()`.

* New function `run_synthetic_comparison()` runs all six testing methods
  (four top-down, two bottom-up) on synthetic experiment data via
  `padj_test_fn()`. Returns a tidy data.table with one row per method.

* Internal helper `derive_delta_hat()` converts `beta_base` and `N_total` to
  the equivalent `delta_hat` for the normal power formula by matching
  root-level power.

## Dependencies

* Now requires `manytestsr (>= 0.0.4)` for `compute_adaptive_alphas()` and
  `alpha_adaptive()`.

# TreeTestSim 0.0.0.9100

* Initial development release with `simulate_test_DT()`,
  `simulate_many_runs_DT()`, `generate_tree_DT()`, local p-value adjustment
  functions, `padj_test_fn()`, `create_effects()`, tau functions, and error
  calculation utilities.
