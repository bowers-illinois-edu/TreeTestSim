# Functions to assess the procedures via simulation. Mostly for use in the paper itself.

#' Create treatment effect, then add tau and test using the SIUP method
#'
#' This function returns a function that carries with it the environment containing the arguments.
#' The idea is to make parallelization easier.
#'
#' @param idat Individual level data
#' @param bdat Data at the block level.
#' @param blockid A character name of the column in idat and bdat indicating the block.
#' @param trtid Is the name of the treatment numeric, (0,1), variable
#' @param fmla A formula with \code{outcome~treatment assignment  | block}
#' where treatment assignment and block must be factors.
#' @param ybase Is the potential outcome to control upon which the treatment effect will be built
#' @param prop_blocks_0 Is the proportion of blocks with no effects at all

#' @param tau_fn Is a function that turns ybase into the potential outcome
#' under treatment --- it is a treatment effect creating function.

#' @param tau_size Is the parameter for the tau_fn --- like the true average
#' effect size within a block.

#' @param by_block Is an argument to [create_effects] to create true effects by
#' block or across the whole dataset

#' @param pfn A function to produce pvalues --- using idat.

#' @param afn A function to adjust alpha at each step. Takes one or more
#' p-values plus a stratum or batch indicator.

#' @param local_adj_p_fn A function used to adjust p-values at each step (the
#' p-values of the children of a given parent.)

#' @param p_adj_method Is "split" to use [manytestsr::find_blocks] for top-down
#' testing and "fdr" or "holm" etc to use [stats::p.adjust] and do the test in
#' every block.

#' @param nsims Is the number of simulations to run --- each simulation uses
#' the same treatment effects be re-assigns treatment (re-shuffles treatment
#' and re-reveals the observed outcomes as a function of the potential
#' outcomes)

#' @param ncores Tells p-value functions how many cores to use. Mostly ignored
#' in use of this function because we are tending to parallelize at higher
#' loops.

#' @param ncores_sim Number of cores used to repeat the simulation.
#' \code{ncores} should be 1 if this is more than one.

#' @param splitfn A function to split the data into two pieces --- using bdat

#' @param covariate is the name of a covariate to be used in created covariate
#' dependent treatment effects. If NULL then the tau_fn should not use a
#' covariate. If "newcov", then create a new covariate with a known (moderate)
#' relationship with the potential outcome under control. This relationship is
#' currently fixed with an R^2 of about .1.

#' @param splitby A string indicating which column in bdat contains a variable
#' to guide splitting (for example, a column with block sizes or block harmonic
#' mean weights or a column with a covariate (or a function of covariates))

#' @param thealpha Is the error rate for a given test (for cases where alphafn
#' is NULL, or the starting alpha for alphafn not null)

#' @param blocksize The character name of the column that measures the block
#' size.

#' @param stop_splitby_constant TRUE is the algorithm should stop splitting
#' when the splitting criteria is constant within set/parent or whether it
#' should continue but split randomly.

#' @param return_details TRUE means that the function should return a list of
#' the original data ("detobj"), a summary of the results ("detresults"), and a
#' node level dataset  ("detnodes"). Default here is FALSE. Only use TRUE when
#' not using simulations.

#' @param bottom_up_adj Is a string for the `p.adjust` function such as
#' "hommel" or "fdr". When doing simulations where `p_adj_method` include such
#' approaches, care is needed.(TODO fix this)

#' @return A pvalue for each block
