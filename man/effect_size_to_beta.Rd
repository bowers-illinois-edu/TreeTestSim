\title{Convert Cohen's d to a Beta distribution shape parameter}
\usage{
effect_size_to_beta(effect_size, N_level, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{effect_size}{Numeric. Cohen's d at each non-null leaf.}

\item{N_level}{Numeric (scalar or vector). Sample size at the relevant
tree level.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric. The nominal significance level.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of Beta shape parameters (one per element of
\code{N_level}).
}
\description{
Given an effect size (Cohen's d), a sample size, and a significance level,
computes the Beta(a, 1) shape parameter \code{a} such that
\code{P(Beta(a,1) < alpha) = power}, where power comes from the normal
approximation for a two-sample test.
