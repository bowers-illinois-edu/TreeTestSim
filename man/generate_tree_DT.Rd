\title{Generate a Complete k-ary Tree as a data.table}
\usage{
generate_tree_DT(max_level, k, t)
}
\arguments{
\item{max_level}{Integer. The maximum level of the tree (with the root at level 0).}

\item{k}{Integer. The branching factor (each internal node has exactly \code{k} children).}

\item{t}{Numeric in \eqn{[0,1]}. The probability that a leaf is non-null (has a treatment effect).}
}
\value{
A data.table with columns \code{node}, \code{level}, \code{parent}, and \code{nonnull}.
}
\description{
Constructs a complete k-ary tree with levels 0 to \code{max_level}.
The tree is stored in a data.table with one row per node and columns for:
\code{node} (the node's index),
\code{level} (its level in the tree, with 0 = root),
\code{parent} (the index of its parent; NA for the root), and
\code{nonnull} (a logical indicating whether the node is non-null).

At the leaves (nodes at \code{level == max_level}), the \code{nonnull} flag
is sampled as \code{TRUE} with probability \code{t}. For internal nodes,
\code{nonnull} is set to \code{TRUE} if any of its children are non-null.
