\arguments{
\item{idat}{Individual level data}

\item{bdat}{Data at the block level.}

\item{blockid}{A character name of the column in idat and bdat indicating the block.}

\item{trtid}{Is the name of the treatment numeric, (0,1), variable}

\item{fmla}{A formula with \code{outcome~treatment assignment  | block}
where treatment assignment and block must be factors.}

\item{ybase}{Is the potential outcome to control upon which the treatment effect will be built}

\item{prop_blocks_0}{Is the proportion of blocks with no effects at all}

\item{tau_fn}{Is a function that turns ybase into the potential outcome
under treatment --- it is a treatment effect creating function.}

\item{tau_size}{Is the parameter for the tau_fn --- like the true average
effect size within a block.}

\item{by_block}{Is an argument to \link{create_effects} to create true effects by
block or across the whole dataset}

\item{pfn}{A function to produce pvalues --- using idat.}

\item{afn}{A function to adjust alpha at each step. Takes one or more
p-values plus a stratum or batch indicator.}

\item{local_adj_p_fn}{A function used to adjust p-values at each step (the
p-values of the children of a given parent.)}

\item{p_adj_method}{Is "split" to use \link[manytestsr:find_blocks]{manytestsr::find_blocks} for top-down
testing and "fdr" or "holm" etc to use \link[stats:p.adjust]{stats::p.adjust} and do the test in
every block.}

\item{nsims}{Is the number of simulations to run --- each simulation uses
the same treatment effects be re-assigns treatment (re-shuffles treatment
and re-reveals the observed outcomes as a function of the potential
outcomes)}

\item{ncores}{Tells p-value functions how many cores to use. Mostly ignored
in use of this function because we are tending to parallelize at higher
loops.}

\item{ncores_sim}{Number of cores used to repeat the simulation.
\code{ncores} should be 1 if this is more than one.}

\item{bottom_up_adj}{Is a string for the \code{p.adjust} function such as
"hommel" or "fdr". When doing simulations where \code{p_adj_method} include such
approaches, care is needed.(TODO fix this)}

\item{splitfn}{A function to split the data into two pieces --- using bdat}

\item{covariate}{is the name of a covariate to be used in created covariate
dependent treatment effects. If NULL then the tau_fn should not use a
covariate. If "newcov", then create a new covariate with a known (moderate)
relationship with the potential outcome under control. This relationship is
currently fixed with an R^2 of about .1.}

\item{splitby}{A string indicating which column in bdat contains a variable
to guide splitting (for example, a column with block sizes or block harmonic
mean weights or a column with a covariate (or a function of covariates))}

\item{thealpha}{Is the error rate for a given test (for cases where alphafn
is NULL, or the starting alpha for alphafn not null)}

\item{blocksize}{The character name of the column that measures the block
size.}

\item{stop_splitby_constant}{TRUE is the algorithm should stop splitting
when the splitting criteria is constant within set/parent or whether it
should continue but split randomly.}

\item{return_details}{TRUE means that the function should return a list of
the original data ("detobj"), a summary of the results ("detresults"), and a
node level dataset  ("detnodes"). Default here is FALSE. Only use TRUE when
not using simulations.}
}
\value{
A pvalue for each block
}
\description{
This function returns a function that carries with it the environment containing the arguments.
The idea is to make parallelization easier.
